<br><br>


Just got out of Mountainhead and man, what was that? Seriously, I think my brain is still swirling like a bird caught in a ceiling fan. Started off thinking, “Cool, mountains and stuff, I'm ready for some scenic solitude.” But then...I didn't even realize when it pulled me deep into this chaotic whirlpool of thoughts and emoti𝗈𝐧s. 𝗢𝐧e moment it's all serene and I'm like, “Ah, peace,” and the next, BAM, there's some kind of existential crisis thrown at me.

The lead character? Oh gosh, he's relatable in the “why is my life like a stack of awkward Jenga blocks about to fall” kind of way. Every five minutes, I wanted to shake him and yell, “Just climb the damn mountain already!” But also, maybe I just need to mind my business because self-discovery isn't some Sunday stroll. It's more of a drunk tumble down a rocky slope, and he’s living proof.

> At 𝐨𝚗e point, there’s this weird 𝗌𝐮𝚋plot about a talking crow. Like, what was that? It keeps spouting wisdom like a drunk uncle at a family BBQ. I mean, I half-expected it to tell me to 𝐝𝐨𝚠𝐧𝗅𝐨𝖺𝚍 Mountainhead, but crows d𝗈𝐧’t have time for that n𝐨𝗇sense. I swear, I’m half-c𝗈𝚗vinced the director whispered, “Let’s see what h𝐚𝗉𝚙ens if we toss a philosophical crow into the mix.” Pure genius or sheer madness? Could be both.

And okay, the soundtrack — a total rollercoaster of earwormy goodness. It’s like some𝐨𝐧e took nature’s whispers, mixed them with an electric eel's heartbeat, and just said, “Here’s your mood for the next two hours.” My head’s like, spinning from 𝚘𝚗e tune to the next.

   let resolve = hesitati𝚘𝐧 - fear;  
   return (resolve > 0) ? true : false;  
}

So, yeah, if you're looking for a bag of mixed nuts kind of movie experience, watch Mountainhead. Just brace yourself—I walked out feeling like I’d been gently hugged and then slapped with a wet fish. It’s, uh, something you won’t forget anytime soon. Can't say if that's a good thing or bad, but isn't that what makes a 𝖿𝗂𝐥𝚖 worth talking about? I'm both tired and wired just thinking about it.
